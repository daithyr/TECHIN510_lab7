## Lessons Learned

Embeddings: Learned how to represent text data as dense vectors (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning, enabling efficient similarity comparisons and search operations.

Semantic Search: Explored techniques to perform semantic search using embeddings, allowing retrieval of relevant documents based on their semantic similarity to a query.

Large-scale Search: Discovered methods to scale semantic search to large document collections by employing approximate nearest neighbor algorithms and efficient indexing structures.
